      <h1>The Transylvanian villages</h1>
      <p> Romania is a picturesque and fascinating country with something for everyone, whether youâ€™re looking for fantastic food, exhilarating hiking, cultural diversity, or turbulent history.
        It is full of small villages where little wrinkled old ladies sit out on their front benches to gossip in the evenings, where shepherds still tend sheep and cows, and where you're more likely to be awoken by a rooster than morning traffic.
       Electricity, satellite dishes and cell phones abound here, but you are able to easily look past them to the essence of life in the Transylvanian countryside.
       You can still find fresh homemade bread, cheese, and butter on the table each night.
       You can get fresh homemade bread, cheese, and butter in the villages.
       Farmers still use horses and carts to do farm work and transport everything from hay to firewood.
       The south-eastern Transylvania region in Romania currently has one of the highest numbers of existing fortified churches from the 13th to 16th centuries. It has more than 150 well preserved fortified churches of a great variety of architectural styles (out of an original 300 fortified churches).
